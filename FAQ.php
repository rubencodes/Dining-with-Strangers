<h1>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions<br><br></h1>
<h2>What is Dining with Strangers?</h2><p style=text-align:justify;>
Dining with Strangers aims to change the way people connect at Bowdoin. By leveraging our shared need to eat and Brunswick’s gastronomic art, students can meet one another in a safe, casual environment. Expanding your social circle to include some awesome polar bears who just happen to inhabit other ice floes is as easy as clicking a few buttons. Moreover, we have developed a set of tools to help you to discover other polar bears who are looking to date and we reward you for treating them to a great meal by partnering with local businesses to deliver great discounts.

<h2>When will the Dining with Strangers iPhone app be available, and how much will it cost me?</h2><p style=text-align:justify;>
iPhone apps are so yesterday. It’s all about the web-app, baby! By building an application for the web that is optimized for computers and mobile devices, we can bring anyone with an Internet-enabled device into the fold. Apple and Google have even realized that this is the best solution, so they have started integrating code that makes our web-app look just like an Android or iPhone app! Download the latest beta version of Chrome on your smartphone and just click “add to home screen” to instantaneously make it like a native app. Dining with Strangers will be free for students without those pesky ads!

<h2>If I sign in with my Bowdoin credentials, does that mean you have access to my student account?</h2><p style=text-align:justify;>
Nope! When you supply your Bowdoin username and password, we just send that information encrypted and directly to Bowdoin’s servers so that they can tell us if you are a real Bowdoin user. When Bowdoin checks your username and password and confirms that you are a student, you are allowed to log in and use the service. We do not store any of your Bowdoin login information. 
</p><br>
<h2>You asked me for details about myself when I signed up; why, who can see this information about me and how can I change it?</h2><p style=text-align:justify;>
Your Business Card (as we call it) is a short message about you that is shown to other people you have dates with. It's meant to be an ice-breaker or a fun fact about yourself that you can use as a basis to spark conversation. This information is only accessible after you have joined a date (or someone has joined yours) to the other date attendees, so rest assured that your major will safely remain among other Bowdoin students. You can change this information at any time by clicking on the fork icon to left of the logout button at the top of the screen.
</p><br>
<h2>What about the messages I send: can any Bowdoin student see those as well?</h2><p style=text-align:justify;>
No, only you and the recipient(s) you chose for the message can see that message. Your messages are stored and encrypted in a database, so your messages are completely private. Moreover, messaging is only accessible before your date. We presume that if liked the person or people with whom you dined, then you’ll probably give out your phone number or exchange other types of contact information. In the unlikely event that you meet a less than savory polar bear, you can rest assured that he or she will not be able to contact you again after your date.

<h2>How does Dining with Strangers date-matching work?</h2><p style=text-align:justify;>
When you first log on, you have the option of creating or joining a date. When dates are created, they join are separated into two separate queues for friendly dates and romantic ones. For friendly dates, the creator sets the maximum number of other users who are able to join; however, the friendly date still takes place as long as one other person joins. Moreover, if someone creates a date for the same time and location as your date, the two of you are automatically matched together. Romantic dates work a bit differently. When a romantic date is created, the creator is asked to supply his or her gender, as well as the gender(s) that he or she is interested in dating. When you go to join a romantic date, you are asked to supply your gender and orientation. The purpose of this is to ensure that you are matched with someone whose orientation matches your own. Romantic dates are capped at two people for obvious reasons. You will be notified via email for both types of dates when a match has been made and you will be invited to chat with this person using our messaging service. 
</p><br>
<h2>I <b>never</b> get dates. Is it something I said?</h2><p style=text-align:justify;>
If you used version 1.0 of our service, then that was probably our bad! We listened to your feedback and made the changes that you recommended to make creating successful dates even easier. If you are still having trouble, then try selecting a popular location and time option, such as a 6:00pm dinner. Not everyone can handle a 4:00am Frosty’s run, so be flexible. It also never hurts to create multiple dates over a few days. Maybe a large swath of campus has exams or papers due on Thursday, so a Wednesday night dinner in town might not be in the cards for them; however, they will certainly need to unwind after all of that work, so why not make a date for both Wednesday and Thursday? You can always leave a date if you are overbooked. 
</p><br>
<h2>How do I cancel a date?</h2><p style=text-align:justify;>
Once your date is ready to go, you can cancel it by going to the View Scheduled Dates page, selecting it from the drop-down menu, and clicking on "Leave this Date?". We suggest you send your fellow diners an apology beforehand, but either way they'll receive an email notifying them that someone left the date.
</p><br>
<h2>That reminds me! I'm not receiving any emails from Dining with Strangers.</h2><p style=text-align:justify;>
Unfortunately, we've had some trouble with Bowdoin's spam-filtering service, and it's possible the messages may have been marked as spam. We recommend you visit the <a href=https://mailfilter.bowdoin.edu/cgi-mod/index.cgi>Bowdoin Mailfilter</a> page and whitelist any messages sent by Dining with Strangers.
</p><br>
<h2>Why can't I make a date specifically with my friend Randy Nichols?</h2><p style=text-align:justify;>
Dining with Strangers is intended to help connect you with students who you don't know; though it's possible you can get matched up with someone you already know, we don't want to take away the element of surprise by having "blind" dates. Also, Randy is a busy man.
</p><br>
<h2>Where can I report a bug or strange activity?</h2><p style=text-align:justify;>
At the bottom of the page, you'll find a "Leave a Comment Card" link that will let you drop us a message about any weird behavior the site may be having, or about any issues you may be having with a particular user. Thanks for the heads up!

<h2>Who's the brilliant, genius mind behind Dining with Strangers and where can I contact them?</h2><p style=text-align:justify;>
Dining with Strangers is a collaborative effort between the Class of 2015’s Ruben Martinez Jr. and Romeo J. Ibanez IV. They're average guys, though they were born with the supernatural ability to convert pizza and caffeine into code, business partners and cash flow. You can find out more about our resident code ninja at his website: <a href=http://rmartinez.co>rmartinez.co</a>.
